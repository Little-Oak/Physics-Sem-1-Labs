# Physics-Sem-1-Labs
This is the repository for all the code we will be using in our labs (assuming this group lasts into the rest of the semester's experiments).

Each file will hold the necessary code for the lab it is named after. 

PLEASE do not add or remove any files without contacting me via messenger or email. 

Thanks!
